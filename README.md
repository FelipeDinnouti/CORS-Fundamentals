## CORS
This is an example project to demonstrate CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) usage.

The project consists in an Express backend API, and in a very simple Frontend to test it.

To run the backend, simply run: 

```bash
cd backend
npm install
node server.js
```

To run the frontend I recommend using serve from npm aswell:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install --global serve
serve -l 3000
```
